# Github-Trending-Android

#### An android App for Github Trending Repos.

This is the Demo App which fetches the list of **Github trending repositories** from
the [API](https://github.com/doforce/github-trending) and displays in the RecyclerView.

The App is based on MVVM architecture and uses LiveData and ViewModel for better performance. It
allows user to select multiple rows to share the url.
